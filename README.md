# PyAlgoTrading_TradingWithIB


This repository contains "Python Algo Trading with Interactive Brokers" UDEMY course material, "ib_insync" notebooks from "ib_insync" repo as well as some option screeners with matplotlib visual output that I created myself. 

Option screeners will evolve to "plotly" interactive graphs eventually.

Option screeners documentation is "TBD"
